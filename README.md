**Task 1:** Exploring and Visualizing a Simple Dataset

---

## 📝 Project Overview

This repository contains the tasks completed during my AI/ML internship at **DeveloperHub**. The primary objective of this first task is to demonstrate proficiency in **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using the Iris Dataset. By applying statistical methods and data visualization, we aim to uncover hidden patterns and understand how different physical features distinguish Iris flower species.

## 🎯 Task Objective

* **Load and Inspect:** Utilize `pandas` to load the dataset and perform initial data health checks.
* **Statistical Analysis:** Apply `.info()` and `.describe()` to understand data types and summary statistics.
* **Data Visualization:** Use `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create:
* **Scatter Plots:** To observe feature relationships.
* **Histograms:** To visualize the distribution of measurements.
* **Box Plots:** To detect and analyze outliers.



## 📊 Dataset Description

The **Iris Dataset** consists of 150 samples from three species of Iris flowers (*Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica*).

* **Features:** Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width.
* **Target:** Species.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook

## 💡 Key Insights

* **Species Identification:** *Iris Setosa* can be easily separated from the other species based solely on petal measurements.
* **High Correlation:** A strong positive correlation exists between petal length and petal width.
* **Outlier Analysis:** Using the IQR method, **4 outliers** were identified in the `sepal_width` column, indicating slight variations within the species.
